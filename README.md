It's NOT a Sonoff Micro

So, I received my shiny new Sonoff Micro in the mail today...

It works...

As far as it goes.

They tried to make a useful device and failed.

The Micro does switch the power to a USB device via WiFi control.  That's pretty much all it does.

What it does not do is pass the data lines through.  This is dumb.

It also uses a new microprocessor that may or may not be hackable.  It's also glued shut.  It's Bloody bulky as well.  These are annoying things.

So, I've spent a couple hours tinkering...

The initial commit here is very much a FUGLY proof of concept.  I plan to refine it a whole bunch as time & energy permit.
